# JavaScript_30_days_challenge
## Introduction
This 30 days javascript challenge is help to improve my javascript skills and improve my confidence in javascript. Here every day one chalange will unlock. It has also a community group there many people communicate and discuss about ant topic.

## Objective
  * Learn and practice javascript fundamental.
  * Develop problem-solving skills.

### Day_01
  #### Variables and Data Types
  * **Task 1:** Declare a variable using var, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.
  * **Task 2:** Declare a variable using let, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.
  * **Task 3:** Declare a variable using const, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.
  * **Task 4:** Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the typeof operator.
  * **Task 5:** Declare a variable using let, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.
  * **Task 6:** Try reassigning a variable declared with const and observe the error.

### Day_1 Conclusion:
    I am easily compleate day 1 task. I hope task diffculty level increase day by day. These tasks demonstrate a thorough understanding of variable declarations, data types, and scope in JavaScript, showcasing the differences between var, let, and const declarations. Mastering variable declarations and data types is crucial for writing efficient, error-free, and maintainable codeÂ inÂ JavaScript.

  * **Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.**
  * **Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.**
  * **Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.**

### Day_2 Conclusion:
    I am easily compleate day 1 task. These tasks demonstrate a solid understanding of basic arithmetic operations, comparison operators, logical operators, and conditional statements in javascript. Mastering these fundamental concepts is essential for building a strong foundation in javascript and solving real-worldÂ problems.
